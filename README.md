## Usefull Links

# ReadMe

This repository contains a collection of links to various Microsoft technologies and services that can help you with your cloud journey. You will find resources on Microsoft Azure, Azure Security, Zero Trust, Cloud Adoption Framework, Well-Architected Framework and more. 

These links will provide you with guidance, best practices, tutorials and tools to design, develop and manage your cloud solutions. You will also find some links on Microsoft 365 services, including Security and Compliance topics, Microsoft Defender and how they integrate with Azure. 

Whether you are new to the cloud or an experienced developer or administrator, you will find something useful here.

I use these links during teaching, community activities, or event sessions.
